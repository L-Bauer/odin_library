# Odin Library

This project was a part of the Javascript coarse.

The goal was to work with basic forms, tables, objects, and object constructors.

## Description

Enter information on a book (author, title, pages, and if you have read the book). All the books entered with their information will be displayed in a table. As you read the books, you can change the status of the book from not read to read. You can also remove the book from the library.
